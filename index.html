                    <p>I am the loving boy of my loving parents. I am 20 years old and studying in class B.Sc(h)cs, my name is Ankit Pandey.

                        I study at Galgotias University, Greater Noida. My grandfather likes to call me Shivam and always takes me out in the morning and evening for a walk.
                        
                        I live with my family in Padari Bazar, Gorakhpur.
                        
                        I go to Collage with my school bus at 8 in the morning and come home at 5:30 in the afternoon.
                        .
                        
                        <p>I enjoy the bus and lunch with my collage friends. I always participate in sports activities and other extra-curricular activities.
                        
                        My Collage organizes inter-Collage competitions every six months, in which I participate. I always get first rank in every competition.</p>
                        
                       <p> To increase my awareness and knowledge, my Collage celebrates all the important events of the year like Independence Day, Republic Day, Christmas, 2 October, Mother’s Day, Teachers’ Day etc.
                        
                        We are advised by our classroom teacher to participate in cultural activities while celebrating any event. I usually participate in poetry recitation or speech recitation.</p>
                        
                       <p> I also like to dance but do not feel so comfortable dancing in the event celebrations. However, I attend the dance at the annual ceremony which is celebrated every year in the month of November.
                        
                        My parents are also invited to the annual Collage ceremony, they take me on a picnic or long tour every holiday in winter or summer season.</p>
                        
                       <p>  I live in a very good society where some programs are organized from time to time to raise awareness among common people about social issues.
                        
                        My father always takes me with him to participate in such programs.
                        
                        My mother always teaches me about ethics and custom to make me a good citizen of India. I always keep my study room and bedroom neat and clean.</p>
